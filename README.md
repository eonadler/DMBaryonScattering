# DMBaryonScattering
This code accompanies the letter Constraints on Dark Matter Microphysics from the Milky Way Satellite Population (https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10000). It implements analytic and numerical calculations of cutoff scales in the linear matter power spectrum for a DM-baryon scattering cosmology, and produces constraints on DM-baryon scattering parameters given constraints on the half-mode mass.
